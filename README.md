# runespy-worker

Distributed worker client for [RuneSpy](https://runespy.com) — a RuneScape player tracking service.

Workers are volunteer-run processes that fetch player data from the RuneMetrics API on the tracker's behalf. The master server never fetches data itself; all API calls go through connected workers.

## How it works

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   Master    │

```

Workers connect over a persistent WebSocket, receive batches of usernames to look up, fetch their RuneMetrics profiles, and stream results back to the master for validation and storage.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or `pip`
- Outbound internet access to `apps.runescape.com` and `secure.runescape.com`
- Approval from the RuneSpy admin before your worker can connect

## Setup

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metalglove/runespy-worker.git
cd runespy-worker
```

**With uv (recommended):**

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

All subsequent `runespy-worker` commands must be prefixed with `uv run` (e.g. `uv run runespy-worker register ...`), or activate the virtual environment first:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**With pip:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

With the venv activated, `runespy-worker` is available directly.

### 2. Register

```bash
runespy-worker register --master wss://runespy.com --name "your-machine-name"
```

This generates an Ed25519 keypair at `~/.runespy/worker_key.pem` and registers with the master. Your worker will be in **pending** status until approved.

Note the **worker ID** printed — you'll need to share it with the admin.

> **Note:** Running `register` again after a keypair already exists will be blocked with a clear error. If you genuinely need to re-register (e.g. you lost your credentials), delete `~/.runespy/worker_key.pem` first.

### 3. Wait for approval

Contact the RuneSpy admin (e.g. via Discord) with your worker ID. The admin will approve your worker and send back an `encrypted_secret` blob.

The secret is only issued once at approval time and is not retrievable again from the server — keep it safe.

### 4. Save the secret and run

```bash
# Save the encrypted secret the admin sent you
runespy-worker save-secret --encrypted <base64_blob>

# Start the worker
runespy-worker run --master wss://runespy.com
```

The worker will authenticate, receive task batches, fetch player profiles, and send results back automatically.

---

## Checking your status

```bash
runespy-worker status --master wss://runespy.com
```

This shows whether your worker is `pending` or `approved`. It does **not** retrieve or display the shared secret — that is sent to you by the admin out-of-band (e.g. Discord) and saved with `save-secret`.

---

## Web UI (Docker)

If you prefer a simple browser UI instead of running the CLI directly, you can use the built-in web UI. It wraps the same `register`, `save-secret`, and `run` commands behind a minimal Flask app and runs everything inside a Docker container.[file:141]

### Build the web UI image

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t runespy-worker-ui .
```

This uses the provided `Dockerfile` to install `runespy-worker` and run the web UI on port 8080.[file:45]

### Run the web UI

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $HOME/.runespy:/root/.runespy \
  runespy-worker-ui
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

The `~/.runespy` directory is bind-mounted from the host so the web UI and any CLI usage share the same credentials (`worker_id`, keypair, and secret). Credentials persist across container restarts. The container does not automatically create credentials or connect to the master on startup; instead, use the web UI flow below to register the worker and save the approved secret into the shared `~/.runespy` directory.

### Flow

1. **Register**

   - Enter a worker name and click **Register**.
   - The UI runs:

     ```bash
     runespy-worker register --master wss://runespy.com --name <name>
     ```

   - This writes `worker_key.pem` and `worker_id` into `~/.runespy`, and the UI shows your worker ID so you can send it to the RuneSpy admin for approval.

2. **Save secret**

   - After the admin approves your worker and sends you the `encrypted_secret` blob, paste it into the **Save secret** form.
   - The UI runs:

     ```bash
     runespy-worker save-secret --encrypted <base64_blob>
     ```

   - This writes `worker_secret.key` into `~/.runespy`. Once the secret is saved, the UI hides the secret input and marks the secret as saved.

3. **Run and manage the worker**

   - When the secret is present, the UI can start the worker inside the same container with:

     ```bash
     runespy-worker run --master wss://runespy.com
     ```

   - The page shows whether the worker process is currently running and exposes **Start worker** and **Restart worker** buttons.
   - On container start, if a secret already exists in `~/.runespy`, the worker is started automatically.

- **Linux**: `sudo systemctl enable docker` (often already enabled)
- **macOS / Windows**: Docker Desktop → Settings → General → enable "Start Docker Desktop when you log in"

The container writes credentials to `~/.runespy/` at startup and connects to the master automatically.

## Credential files

| Path | Contents | Permissions |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `~/.runespy/worker_key.pem` | Ed25519 private key (PEM/PKCS8) | 0600 |
| `~/.runespy/worker_secret.key` | Raw 32-byte HMAC shared secret | 0600 |
| `~/.runespy/worker_id` | Worker UUID (not secret) | default |

Both secret files are created with `chmod 600` automatically.

---

## Security model

Each worker is authenticated with a two-factor scheme:

1. **Ed25519 challenge-response** — on every connection the server sends a random nonce; the worker signs it with its private key and the server verifies the signature against the registered public key.
2. **HMAC-SHA256 message signing** — all messages are signed with a 32-byte shared secret issued at approval time. The server stores only a bcrypt hash of this secret; the plaintext is delivered once, encrypted with AES-GCM keyed from your public key.

Workers that submit structurally invalid, temporally inconsistent, or suspiciously-timed data accumulate violation counts. Repeated hard violations result in suspension.

### What the server validates on every result

- **Structural**: all required keys present, exactly 29 skills, valid level/XP ranges, skill XP sums match totals
- **Temporal**: XP, levels, and quest counts never decrease relative to the stored history
- **Timing**: fetch timestamp within 60 seconds of server time, fetch duration within a plausible range (5ms–30s)

### What this worker fetches

- `https://apps.runescape.com/runemetrics/profile/profile` — player profile (XP, skills, activities)
- `https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore/index_lite.ws` — hiscores fallback for private profiles

No credentials, cookies, or account data are ever accessed. Only public RuneMetrics and hiscores endpoints are used.

## Protocol overview

All worker-to-server messages use a signed JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "type": "<message_type>",
  "id": "<uuid4>",
  "ts": 1741305600.123,
  "worker_id": "<worker_uuid>",
  "hmac": "<hex_digest>",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

### Authentication flow

```
Worker                          Master
  │                               │
  │──── connect ──────────────────▶│
  │◀──── challenge {nonce} ────────│
  │──── auth {sig, hmac} ─────────▶│
  │◀──── config {delay, limits} ───│
  │──── ready {capacity} ─────────▶│
  │◀──── assign_batch {tasks} ─────│
  │──── batch_result {results} ───▶│
  │         ...                    │
```

### Task lifecycle

```
PENDING ──▶ ASSIGNED ──▶ SUCCESS
                    └──▶ FAILED ──▶ (retry, max 3)
                               └──▶ DEAD_LETTER
```

## Using proxies

Workers can optionally route API requests through HTTP proxies. This spreads traffic across multiple IPs, allowing higher throughput and reducing the chance of rate limiting.

[Webshare](https://www.webshare.io/) is the recommended provider. Their shared datacenter proxy plan at $2.99/mo (100 proxies, 250 GB bandwidth) is sufficient for tracking up to ~10,000 players at 20-minute intervals.

### Setup

1. Create a [Webshare](https://www.webshare.io/) account (free tier includes 10 proxies)
2. Go to **Dashboard > API** and copy your API key
3. Pass it when starting your worker:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export WEBSHARE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
runespy-worker run --master wss://runespy.com

# Or via CLI flag
runespy-worker run --master wss://runespy.com --webshare-api-key "your-api-key"
```

The worker automatically fetches your proxy list from Webshare's API on startup and rotates through them round-robin. The master detects how many proxies you have and scales your rate limits and concurrency accordingly — no manual tuning needed.

### Docker with proxies

Add the environment variable to your `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e WORKER_ID="$(cat ~/.runespy/worker_id)" \
  -e WORKER_KEY_PEM_B64="$(base64 < ~/.runespy/worker_key.pem)" \
  -e WORKER_SECRET_B64="$(base64 < ~/.runespy/worker_secret.key)" \
  -e MASTER_URL="wss://runespy.com" \
  -e WEBSHARE_API_KEY="your-api-key" \
  --name runespy-worker \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  runespy-worker
```

### Single proxy

If you have your own proxy (not from Webshare), you can pass it directly:

```bash
runespy-worker run --master wss://runespy.com --proxy-url "http://user:pass@host:port"
```

### Scaling reference

| Proxies | Players (20-min poll) | Webshare plan |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| 10 | ~1,000 | Free |
| 50 | ~5,000 | 100 proxies ($2.99/mo) |
| 100 | ~10,000 | 100 proxies ($2.99/mo) |
