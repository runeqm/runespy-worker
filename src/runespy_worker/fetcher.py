"""RuneMetrics profile fetcher with hiscores fallback.

Primary source — RuneMetrics API
---------------------------------
``fetch_profile`` hits ``https://apps.runescape.com/runemetrics/profile/profile``
and returns the JSON blob directly.  The API returns ``{"error": "..."}`` for
private profiles and several other edge cases; the error message is compared
case-insensitively against ``_PRIVATE_ERRORS`` to distinguish a private profile
(``PROFILE_PRIVATE``) from a genuine API failure (``API_ERROR``).

Fallback — hiscores lite CSV
------------------------------
When RuneMetrics reports ``PROFILE_PRIVATE``, ``fetch_hiscores`` is tried.
Some players who hide their RuneMetrics profile still appear on the public
hiscores, providing at least their skill levels and XP.

The hiscores lite endpoint returns a plain-text CSV with one row per tracked
skill, plus an overall totals row prepended:

    Row 0   — Overall totals (rank, total_level, total_xp).  Stored separately;
              NOT added to ``skillvalues``.
    Row 1   — Skill 0 (Attack).  Becomes ``{"id": 0, ...}``.
    Row 2   — Skill 1 (Defence).  Becomes ``{"id": 1, ...}``.
    ...
    Row 29  — Skill 28 (Invention).  Becomes ``{"id": 28, ...}``.

RS3 tracks 29 skills (rows 1-29).  Only the first ``n_skills + 1`` rows are
parsed; activity rows that follow are ignored.

XP unit difference: the hiscores API returns XP values already divided by 10
(truncated to the nearest 0.1 XP).  To align with the RuneMetrics format (which
uses tenths of XP), every ``xp`` value is multiplied by 10 before being stored.

The synthesised result dict sets ``"_source": "hiscores"`` so the server can
distinguish it from a full RuneMetrics response and apply appropriate validation
rules (e.g. no ``activities`` field is present).

      and ``rank``.  Row 0 of the CSV is the overall totals row; it is stored
      as ``totalskill`` / ``totalxp`` and excluded from the per-skill list.
    - ``activities`` — always ``[]`` (hiscores provides no activity feed).
    - ``_source`` — set to ``"hiscores"`` so the server can apply appropriate
      validation rules for this reduced data set.

    always gets a clean ``API_ERROR`` rather than a parse exception.
