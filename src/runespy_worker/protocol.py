"""Message envelope construction and HMAC verification for the worker protocol.

Every message sent by the worker uses a signed JSON envelope:

    {
        "type":      "<message_type>",
        "id":        "<uuid4>",          # unique per message; used for dedup
        "ts":        1741305600.123,      # Unix timestamp; server rejects if >30s old
        "worker_id": "<worker_uuid>",
        "payload":   { ... },            # message-type-specific data
        "hmac":      "<hex_digest>"      # HMAC-SHA256 over all other fields
    }

The HMAC is computed over a canonical JSON representation of the message
with the "hmac" key excluded (since its value isn't known yet at signing
time). Keys are sorted and whitespace is stripped to ensure a deterministic
byte sequence regardless of insertion order.

Server-to-worker messages (challenge, config, assign_batch, heartbeat_ack,
shutdown, revoke) are not HMAC-signed by the server; the worker accepts them
based on the authenticated WebSocket session alone.
